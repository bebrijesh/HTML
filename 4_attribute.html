    Q. What is an HTML attribute?
    - An HTML attribute is a keyword used to provide additional information about an HTML element. It's like adding modifiers to a word to change its meaning or usage.

    Q. Why are HTML Attributes Important?
    - Customization: Attributes allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of elements.
    - Functionality: Attributes can add interactive features to elements, such as links, images, and forms.
    - Contextual Information: Attributes can provide context about the content of an element, like the alt attribute for images.

    Q. How do attributes work?
    - Attributes are declared within the opening tag of an HTML element, using the name-value pair format.

    Syntax
    <element_name attribute_name="attribute_value">
    Content
    </element_name>
    -->

    <!-- Example -->
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Link to Example Website</a>

    <!-- 
     Note
    - Not all elements have attributes.
    - The same attribute can be used with different elements, but the effect may vary.
    - Some attributes are required for certain elements to function correctly.
    - Attribute values can be text, numbers, or expressions.
