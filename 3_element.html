    Q. What is an HTML Element?
    - An HTML element is the building block of an HTML document. It's like a word in a sentence, defining the structure and content of a webpage.

    Q. Why are HTML Elements Important?
    - Structure: Elements define the hierarchical structure of a webpage, determining how content is organized and displayed.
    - Content: Elements hold the actual content of a webpage, such as text, images, and links.
    - Formatting: Elements apply formatting to content, controlling its appearance (e.g., bold, italic, headings).
    - Functionality: Elements can add interactive features to a webpage, like forms, buttons, and scripts.
    
    Q. How do HTML Elements Work?
    - HTML elements are defined by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). They typically come in pairs:
    - Opening tag: <element_name>
    - Closing tag: </element_name>

    Syntax
    <element_name>
    Content
    </element_name>    
    
    Analogy
    - Think of HTML elements as Lego bricks. Each brick has a specific shape and purpose. By combining different bricks in various ways, you can build complex structures, just like you can create complex web pages by combining HTML elements.
